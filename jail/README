This README is for the setup of a Java Jail.
Thanks to http://github.com/daveagp/java_jail

The purpose of this jail is to run java code using chroot. To do such things we need java binaries and some OS files.

The content of this directory should be as follow:
./java - Copy of unzipped java installation
./etc - Necessary OS libs
./lib64 - Necessary OS libs
./lib - Necessary OS libs (Ubuntu)
./dev - Necessary pseudo-files
./proc - Necessary pseudo-files

Each folder contains a .gitignore with the list of files that should be present.
For the pseudo-files, execute the following commands:

For proc:
	mkdir proc
	sudo mount --bind /proc ./proc

For dev:
	sudo mknod -m 0666 ./dev/null c 1 3
        sudo mknod -m 0666 ./dev/random c 1 8
        sudo mknod -m 0444 ./dev/urandom c 1 9

Recommended Permissions:

Non temporary files and folder permissions: 666
Temporary folder permission: 766

Additional Notes:
Normal logic dictates that you should not make this directoy available trough http.
