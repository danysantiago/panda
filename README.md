Summary
-------

Panda is a code grading system developed during the Fall of 2013 for the Capstone course in the University of Puerto Rico. Panda was developed using Node.js, MongoDB, Angular.js and uses Git with GiitLab. The system is intended to be used by both students and professors. It is accessed through a web browser and through git clients. The professors create courses, assignments and the test cases for grading such assignments. The students enroll into courses and complete their assignments, which are submitted through git and are automatically graded. Professors can then see studentsâ€™ submissions with details of the grading performed on their code, including pass or failed test cases, I/O consumption, compile time and runtime, memory usage and if any, stack traces or logs of compile problems, runtime exceptions and submissions errors. Currently grading is done on Java only source code and is fully sandboxed. More details of the project can be found in the System Details Documents (link to PDF below). On page 84 are screenshots of the final product that can lead to a better understanding of the system.
